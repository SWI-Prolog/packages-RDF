[Sep 10 2009]

 * MODIFIED: Dropped support for old RDF Bag/Alt/Seq syntax.

 * ENHANCED: Speedup processing of xml: properties in RDF/XML parser.

 * ENHANCED: Compile-time expansion of the term-rewriter that is used by
   the RDF/XML parser.

[Aug 20 2009]

 * FIXED: Support for \U in rdf_ntriples.pl (used to parse W3C test results)

[Jul 30 2009]

 * CLEANUP: Modernise rdf.pl and rdf_db.pl module handling.

[Jul 2 2009]

 * FIXED: handle rdf:datatype earlier (compliant to the revised RDF syntax
   specs). This fixes empty strings using
   <rdfs:label rdf:datatype="&xsd;string"/>

   Spotted by Chris Mungall

[Jun 22 2009]

 * FIXED: avoid bnodes in types nodes for rdf_write_xml/2.

[Jun 9 2009]

 * FIXED: RDF typed-nodes (<ns:Class ...>...</ns:Class> descriptions) if the expansion of ns contains %-escaped characters.  Jochem Liem.

[Mar 19 2009]

 * CLEANUP: Removed all trailing whitespace from all source-files.  This avoids many GIT (merge) warnings.
[Mar 12 2009]

 * MODIFIED: Renamed concat_atom/2,3 into atomic_list_concat/2,3 for compatibility.  Moved the old predicates into library(backcomp).  It is adviced to update your code, but 99% of the code will remain working because the old definitions are autoloaded.

[Mar 6 2009]

 * FIXED: rdf_write_xml with different encodings.  Patch by Keri Harris.
[Jan 21 2009]

 * FIXED: RDF writer: write valid XML if the namespace entity contains characters
   that must be %-escaped.  Jacopo Urbani.

[Jan 13 2009]

 * FIXED: RDF/XML could save illegal XML if multiple namespaces are used
   for predicates where one namespace is a prefix of another one.  Jacopo Urbani.
[Dec 19 2008]

 * ADDED: Pass content_length through process_rdf/3
[Sep 11 2008]

 * PORT: Add AC_PREREQ to configure.h for systems that auto-select autoconf
   versions.  After tip by Ulrich Neumerkel.

[Aug 11 2008]

 * INSTALL: Remove all configure files from the git repository
[Apr 18 2008]

 * MODIFIED: Renamed hash_term/2 to term_hash/2.  Added hash_term/2 to
   library(backcomp), so most code should not notice this.
[Feb 28 2008]

 * FIXED: rdf_write_xml/2 loops if it encounters an rdf:Bag.

[Feb 18 2008]

 * FIXED: More fixes for proper handling of rdf:Bag

[Feb 13 2008]

 * FIXED: Emit rdf:Bag attributes (etc.) as rdf:li

 * FIXED: possible failure in rdf_write_xml with http://t-d-b.org?

[Jan 14 2008]

 * FIXED: Bug#343: Handling bnodes in rdf_write_xml.  Yver Raimond.

 * FIXED: Added support for rdf:NodeID to rdf_write_xml/2.  Yves Raimond.

[Dec 13 2007]

 * FIXED: library(rdf_write) to deal with operators.  Related to Bug#332

Oct 29, 2007

  * FIXED: extract namespaces used in typed literals.   Yves Raimond.

Jul 9, 2007

  * FIXED: xml:lang with empty literals.  Jochem Liem.

Jun 14, 2007

  * FIXED: return rdf:parseType="Literal" as literal of type
    rdf:XMLLiteral.

Jan 18, 2007

  * ADDED: embedded(Bool) option to process_rdf/3

Jun 25, 2006

  * CLEANUP: Delete unused global variable.

Jun 5, 2006

  * FIXED: decoding of unicode-URIs using UTF-8 over %XX%XX.

Apr 13, 2006

  * ADDED: library rdf_write to write an RDF file from a list of triples.

Dec 8, 2005

  * FIXED: xmlns attributes in descriptions.  Bijan Parsia

Nov 23, 2005

  * ADDED: option db(DB) to parse_rdf/2.

Nov 10, 2005

  * COMMENT: Comment use of IRI

Jul 7, 2005

  * ADDED: Pass entity(Name, Value) to XML parser

Jul 5, 2005

  * FIXED: Perform proper URI decoding to Unicode atoms

Jul 4, 2005

  * FIXED: Make "make check" work from the build directory.

Mar 31, 2005

Mar 29, 2005

Oct 21, 2004

  * FIXED: Bug#196: avoid need for autoloading.  Sandro Hawke.

Sep 13, 2004

    instead returns the plain atoms.

Jul 31, 2004

  * ADDED: converted rdf_nt.pl into public rdf_ntriples.pl library for
    loading data in the W3C ntriple format.

Jun 29, 2004

  * FIXED: sharing code for blank nodes.  Broken in recent cleanup.

Jun 17, 2004

  * CLEANUP: start/end of loading a file, use option/3 from library

Apr 21, 2004

  * ADDED: Support for xml:lang and rdf:dataType attributes.

  * INTERNAL: Use global variables rather than assert/retract for
    keeping track of the state for process_rdf/3.

Nov 29, 2003

  * ADDED: warning for incorrect and multiple definitions of rdf:ID.
    Maarten Menken.

Nov 7, 2003

  * ADDED: process_rdf/3: allow processing from a stream

Oct 6, 2003

  * MODIFIED: synopsis of process_rdf/3 to
    process_rdf(+File, :OnTriples, +Options) for consistency and to allow
    extending the option list.  Old calls are mapped to the new.

  * Added option blank_nodes(share) to load_rdf/3 and process_rdf/3.

Aug 18, 2003

  * Guarantee that anonymous ids start with __

Mar 20, 2003

  * Fixed exception in cleanup.  Dominique de Waleffe.

Feb 28, 2003

  * ADDED: Use BaseURI to create non-conflicting anonymous resources.

  * FIXED: rdf_parser:global_id to ignore xml:base for absolute URIs

Jan 17, 2003

  * FIXED: online.pl (web frontend) to avoid using goal/1 option for the
    xml parser.  Now uses 4.0.8 clib memfile library primitives.

  * FIXED: process_rdf/3, Peter Marks.

  * ADDED: parseType="Collection", satisfying the W3C Working Draft
    8 November 2002.

################################################################
# Sumary of incompatibilities:
#
#	Many problems in nested bag handling, changing output of
#	suite/t5.rdf
#
#	Content of Alt-container was incorrectly rendered as rdf:li
#	instead of rdf:_1, rdf:_2, etc (suite/t27.rdf).
################################################################

  * ADDED: Translate rdf:li predicates into _1, _2, etc.

  * FIXED: parseType=Literal to avoid extraneous [..] around the value

Oct 28, 2002

  * CLEANUP: pass base-uri as attribute, preparing for xml:base and making
    the parser ready for multi-threading.

Sep 16, 2002

  * MODIFIED: Allow for unqualified attribute-names

  * ADDED: "make check"

Older entries

  * FIXED: Type-exception in atom_chars/2

  * FIXED: handling mixed <name>literal</name> and <name>object</name>
    (space canonisation problem).

  * CGI Demo: report errors generated before a fatal exception.

  * FIXED: handling of propertyElt of the form
    rdf:ID="myid" rdf:parseType="Resource"

  * For objects, map NameSpace:Local to the simple concatenation of the two.
    This implies:

	# Subjects are always atoms
	# Predicates are NameSpace:LocalName or simply Name
	# Objects are atoms (URI) or literal(Value)

  * Warn on things that cannot be converted into an RDF-object rather then
    failing silently.

  * Removed some undesirable choice-points.
